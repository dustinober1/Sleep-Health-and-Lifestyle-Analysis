## Project Rubric

The project is assessed based on **two main categories**: **Statistical Analyses** and **Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out**.

---

### I. Statistical Analyses (Core Requirements)

These are the **mandatory** criteria for the project to pass:

| Criteria | Submission Requirements (What to Ensure) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Correct Values for All Statistical Results** | **All numerical statistics** (mean, median, SD, etc.) must be **calculated correctly**. |
| **Correct Identification of Variable Types** | You must correctly identify and provide examples for **all four data types** (Continuous, Integer, Ordinal, Nominal) in the Data Description slide. |
| **Correctly Identify Measures of Center and Measures of Spread** | When the slide asks for a **Measure of Center** (e.g., Mean, Median), you must provide a measure of center. When it asks for a **Measure of Spread** (e.g., SD, Range), you must provide a measure of spread. *Do not mix them up.* |
| **Correctly Plot Distribution of Heart Rates** | The heart rate plot must be included and you must **identify possible outliers** (if any) in the distribution. |

### II. Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out (Bonus/Excellence)

These are recommendations that will take your project above the basic requirements:

1.  **Relate Mean & Median to Shape:** Explicitly discuss how the relationship between the **mean and median** for different variables indicates the **skewness** (shape) of the distribution.
    * *Recall:* Mean $\approx$ Median $\rightarrow$ Symmetric; Mean $>$ Median $\rightarrow$ Right-Skewed.
2.  **Provide Multiple Measures:** When asked for a measure of center or spread, try to provide **multiple** relevant metrics.
    * *Example:* When asked for Standard Deviation (Spread), also provide the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** or **Variance**.
    * *Example:* When asked for Mean (Center), provide the **Median** and **Mode**.
