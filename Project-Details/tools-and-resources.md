# Tools and Resources

## Helpful Resources for Computing Statistics

You are free to compute your summary statistics via any methodâ€”choose the tool you are most comfortable with. This includes using:

* **Spreadsheet software** such as Google Sheets or Excel
* **Python**, including Python libraries like pandas or NumPy
* **Online calculators** (e.g. searching online for "standard deviation calculator")
* **AI tools** (like ChatGPT)

You can even run the same calculations in multiple places, to confirm that you are getting consistent answers. The graded component of this project will be your slide deck presentation, where you report the results of these calculations.

## Spreadsheet Formulas

If you would like to compute directly in Google Sheets or Excel, below are helpful commands.

* **Mean:** `=AVERAGE([select cells])`
* **Median:** `=MEDIAN([select cells])`
* **Mode:** `=MODE([select cells])`
* **Minimum:** `=MIN([select cells])`
* **Maximum:** `=MAX([select cells])`
* **Standard Deviation:** `=STDEV([select cells])`
* **Variance:** `=VAR([select cells])`

In Google Sheets, you can also select a column then **Data > Column stats**, which will provide the distribution as well as some helpful column statistics.
