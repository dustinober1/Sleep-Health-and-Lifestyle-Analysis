Presentation Summary for Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

This file lists recommended slides, visuals, and talking points to include in your PowerPoint. Use the notebook `analysis.ipynb` to generate the figures and numbers.

Slide suggestions (order):

1. Title Slide
   - Project title, your name, date, course/instructor.

2. Motivation & Research Question
   - Why sleep health matters.
   - Primary questions we investigate (e.g., which lifestyle factors most strongly associate with sleep duration/quality?).

3. Dataset Overview
   - Number of participants (rows), key variables (sleep duration, sleep quality indicators, demographics, lifestyle: caffeine, alcohol, physical activity, BMI, stress).
   - Data collection source: mention file `sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset-sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`.

4. Data Quality & Preprocessing
   - Missing data summary and handling steps (imputation, dropped duplicates).
   - Any date/time conversions or derived features created (e.g., BMI category, sleep category).

5. Exploratory Findings (visuals)
   - Distribution of sleep duration (histogram).
   - Boxplot of sleep by key categorical variable (e.g., smoking status or activity level).
   - Scatter plot: sleep duration vs. stress or BMI (with regression line).
   - Correlation heatmap of numeric variables highlighting strongest associations.

6. Modeling / Predictive Insights
   - Brief description of model used (linear regression or tree-based), target variable, predictors.
   - Model performance (RMSE, R^2) and most important predictors.

7. Key Takeaways
   - Top 3 findings and practical implications.
   - Limitations (observational data, missingness, potential confounders).

8. Recommendations & Next Steps
   - Suggestions for further analysis, data to collect, or interventions.

9. Appendix / Additional plots
   - Any extra figures or tables (cross-tabs, subgroup analyses).

Notes for building slides:
- Keep visuals large and readable; include axis labels and short captions.
- For each figure, add one bullet interpreting the main message.
- Use consistent color palette and font sizes.

Files generated by the notebook:
- `analysis.ipynb` : the analysis notebook (generate figures and tables)
- `outputs/figures/` : exported PNGs to include in slides

Good luck preparing your presentation! If you want, I can also export key figures into a PPTX automatically or create suggested text for each slide.
