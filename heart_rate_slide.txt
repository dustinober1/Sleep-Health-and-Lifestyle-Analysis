Distribution of Heart Rates

Key Statistics
Average Heart Rate: 70.17 bpm
Median Heart Rate: 70.0 bpm
Standard Deviation: 4.14 bpm
Range: 65.00 - 86.00 bpm
Distribution: Normal distribution with slight positive skew

Data Distribution
Most participants (75th percentile): Up to 73.0 bpm
Lowest 25% of participants: As low as 67.0 bpm
High heart rate individuals: Up to 86.0 bpm
Majority fall within 66-75 bpm range

Outliers Identification
Potential outliers: 15 individuals (4% of dataset)
Outlier range: Values below 62.0 bpm or above 78.0 bpm
Highest outlier: 86.0 bpm
Lowest outlier: 65.0 bpm (not considered a true outlier)

Relationship to Health Indicators
Positive correlation with stress levels
Slight correlation with BMI category (higher BMI, higher heart rate)
Participants with sleep disorders show elevated average heart rates
Heart rate varies by sleep disorder type: None (70.0 bpm), Insomnia (70.4 bpm), Sleep Apnea (73.3 bpm)

Implications
Most participants have healthy resting heart rates within normal range (60-100 bpm)
Sleep Apnea patients show significantly higher average heart rates
Elevated heart rates correlate with stress and poor sleep quality
Heart rate serves as an important vital sign indicator for sleep health
